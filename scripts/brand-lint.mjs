/**
 * Brand-messaging terminology lint (downstream check).
 *
 * Canonical source: `.claude/skills/brand-messaging.md` (§3 terminology, §7
 * enforcement) in the faultmaven repo. This is the downstream copy for the
 * Dashboard. Stdlib only.
 *
 * Two pattern classes, per the skill's "Authority by rule type", each with its
 * own file list:
 *   - UNIVERSAL : terminology — every brand-facing surface, prose or not.
 *   - CORE_ONLY : positioning/audience/tone. Canonical applies these to its own
 *     manifest (pyproject.toml) and excludes only CLAUDE.md, a dev guide — so
 *     excluding package.json here is a JS-ecosystem judgement, NOT canonical's
 *     rule: package.json carries dependency names and npm scripts, where
 *     'leverage'/'utilize' show up as third-party names nobody can rename, and
 *     JSON has no comment syntax, so the 'brand-lint: allow' escape hatch below
 *     cannot reach them.
 *
 * The dashboard's src/ is application code / UI copy (a product-design concern,
 * out of brand-skill scope), so it is not scanned. 'AIOps platform' /
 * 'observability platform' / 'playbook' are intentionally NOT grepped — they're
 * used by contrast; enforced by review.
 *
 * Put 'brand-lint: allow' on a line to whitelist a deliberate, justified use.
 * When retiring a NEW term, add it here AND to brand-messaging.md §7 together.
