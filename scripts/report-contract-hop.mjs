/**
 * WHAT A CONTRACT PIN BUMP CROSSED — printed, never enforced.
 *
 * `api-types-drift` asserts the pinned `contractVersion` equals the version the
 * pinned ref serves. That is the CORRECTNESS leg and it is satisfied by a hop of
 * any size: 3.5.0 → 3.7.0 passes exactly as 3.5.0 → 3.6.0 does.
 *
 * It happened. A dashboard pin bump described as adopting 3.7.0's turn ordinal
 * also carried 3.6.0, in which `POST /knowledge/documents` stopped requiring
 * `platform_admin` unconditionally — an authorization change, fully green, named
 * nowhere in the pull request. A reviewer trusting the description would have
 * approved a change they were never shown, and no gate could have told them.
 *
 * So this reads the API's own `contract_version.py` and prints every entry
 * strictly above the old pin and at or below the new one. It is a DISCLOSURE
 * aid, not a rule: it never fails, because how many contracts a bump may cross
 * is a judgement, and a script answering it would make the agreement on the
 * reviewer's behalf — the same reason the breaking-change differ upstream is
 * advisory.
 *
 *     node scripts/report-contract-hop.mjs <base-ref>
 *
 * With no base ref, or when the pin did not move, it prints nothing and exits 0.
