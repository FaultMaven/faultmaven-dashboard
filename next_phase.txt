Project Summary: FaultMaven Copilot - API Integration & UI Refinement (Phase 2 Completion)

Issue:
The original FaultMaven browser extension was using mock responses and incorrect API endpoints. The app needed proper integration with the FaultMaven API server using the correct endpoints and request formats for session management, data upload, and query processing.

Improvements Made (Phase 2):

🔌 API Integration: Replaced mock responses with real API calls to FaultMaven backend using correct endpoints and request formats.

🔄 Session Management: Implemented proper session creation, persistence, and heartbeat management for conversation continuity.

📤 Data Upload: Added real data upload functionality with insights and file management.

💬 Query Processing: Updated query system to use proper API endpoints with context, priority, and enhanced response formatting.

🔧 Configuration: Added flexible API endpoint configuration for development and production environments.

🧩 UI Refinements: Maintained and enhanced the refined layout from Phase 1 with better visual hierarchy and user experience.

Next Phase: Proposed Improvements

🎯 Enhanced Session Management:
- Session naming and labeling for better organization
- Session history and switching between conversations
- Session export/import functionality

📊 Advanced Analytics:
- Query performance metrics and response times
- Confidence score visualization and trends
- Usage analytics and insights

🔍 Improved Data Handling:
- Data preview before upload
- File type validation and size limits
- Batch upload capabilities

📱 Enhanced UX:
- Real-time typing indicators
- Message timestamps and threading
- Responsive design for narrow side panels
- Dark mode support

UX Enhancements:

Add tooltips for each radio button and action.

Provide subtle animation on submission or loading.

Show character count for inputs (especially logs).

Styling Polish:

Use color tokens for theming consistency.

Create reusable button and section components for maintainability.

When you resume, we can pick up from any of these priorities—or refine the scope based on your next goal
