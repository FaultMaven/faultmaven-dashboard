**FaultMaven Copilot** is an AI-powered troubleshooting assistant embedded directly in your browser as a side panel. It provides **engineers—especially in SRE and DevOps roles**—with in-context help, analyzes web content, and enables users to interact with the FaultMaven AI to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently.

This extension is built using the modern **WXT framework**, with **React 19+**, **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**, and comprehensive **testing infrastructure**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+ recommended)
  * [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (v8+ recommended)
  * A running instance of the **FaultMaven Backend API**.

### Setup

1.  **Run the Backend First**: The Copilot requires a running FaultMaven API server to function. Ensure your backend is running at `http://api.faultmaven.local:8000` or update the configuration accordingly.

2.  **Clone this Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/faultmaven-copilot.git
    cd faultmaven-copilot
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    This command will also run `wxt prepare` to set up the development environment.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file from the example template:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

    Edit `.env.local` to configure your settings:

    ```bash
    # Backend API endpoint (required)
    VITE_API_URL=http://api.faultmaven.local:8000

    # Input limits (optional - uncomment to customize)
    #VITE_DATA_MODE_LINES=100        # Lines to trigger data upload mode
    #VITE_MAX_QUERY_LENGTH=10000     # Max input characters
    #VITE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10        # Max file upload size in MB
    ```

    **Available Configuration Options:**
    - **`VITE_API_URL`**: Backend API endpoint (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)
    - **`VITE_DATA_MODE_LINES`**: Smart detection threshold - lines that trigger data upload mode (default: `100`)
    - **`VITE_MAX_QUERY_LENGTH`**: Maximum characters in text input (default: `10000`)
    - **`VITE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`**: Maximum file upload size in megabytes (default: `10`)

    See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for complete documentation.

5.  **Fonts**: The UI uses the Inter typeface for crisp readability.

    - Inter is bundled via `@fontsource/inter` and enabled by Tailwind `font-sans`.

### Development Workflow

Start the dev server, which enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test --watch

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Load the Extension in Chrome

1.  Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
3.  Click **Load unpacked**.
4.  Select the `.output/chrome-mv3-dev/` folder from this project's directory.

The **FaultMaven Copilot** icon will now appear in your browser toolbar, and the side panel will be available.

### First-Run Setup

When you open the extension for the first time, you'll see a welcome screen with two deployment options:

1. **Enterprise Cloud (Recommended)**: Zero setup - connects to `https://api.faultmaven.ai`
2. **Self-Hosted**: For running your own backend - connects to `http://localhost:8000`

After setup, the extension will automatically adapt its UI based on the backend capabilities.

### Changing API Endpoint

To change the API endpoint after initial setup:

1. Right-click the extension icon → **Options**
2. Enter your API endpoint URL
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify
4. Click **Save Settings** and refresh the extension

The extension supports both self-hosted and enterprise deployments with the same binary.
